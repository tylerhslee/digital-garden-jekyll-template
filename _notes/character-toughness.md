title: Character toughness
---

Toughness naturally reduces incoming damage. It is not "armor", which is granted through some form of dermal transformation or wearing protective gear. Toughness is inherent to the individual; it is best described as an individual's tolerance to pain.

Thus, toughness cannot be reduced in any way without altering the physical and/or psychological composition of the character. It is also very difficult to increase as it is only achievable through relentless resistance training and exposure to pain.
