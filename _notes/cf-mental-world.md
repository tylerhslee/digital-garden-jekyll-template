title: All cognitive functions are about the mental world
---

There are a lot of misconceptions about sensors, especially Se-doms. I suspect the problem is with the framework's tendency to interpret the S/N dichotomoy as physical vs. metaphysical.

That is simply incorrect.

The question of physical vs. metaphysical relates to [[not-about-capacity|one's mental capacity, not function]]. Because cognitive functions are inherently psychological manifestations, it would make no sense to introduce the idea of physicality at all. Unfortunately, this line tends to get murky with today's prevalence of misinformation on the Internet, and especially [[se-not-physical|the perception around Se has been most significantly distorted]].
