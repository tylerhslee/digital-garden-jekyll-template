title: Se is not about the physical world
---

Se is not about the physical surroundings or being in "tune" with your body. Se, just like the other 7 functions, describes a specific way in which our mind perceives the world. To understand it better, we should contrast Se with Ne, as both are extraverted perceiving (Pe) functions.

The most profound difference between Ne and Se is in how the energy is released through extraversion. While Ne prefers to keep the engagement light and fleeting, Se is more so on a "hunt" - hunt for something interesting. As a result, even though both functions can appear to be scattered at the surface level, Se is distinctive from Ne in that it is looking for the "next fix".

This distinction is where we get the misconception that Se is more about the physical world than the metaphysical. In truth, Se is interested in knowing the _reality_ of something, and its exploration is bound by the "what is". Contrast that with Ne, which is more preoccupied with the _possibility_ of something, where there are no bounds to its imagination. You can see how it almost sounds like the difference between Se's and Ne's interest is in tangibility of the object. But there are certainly subtleties that add more nuance to that.

Ne, in its purest form, asks: "What else is there to this knowledge? How can I evolve this knowledge? What does this say about other undiscovered knowledges?"

Se, in its purest form, asks: "Is this all there is to this knowledge? How is this knowledge being applied today? What is the immediate value of this knowledge?"
