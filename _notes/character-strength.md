title: Character strength
---

Strength determines how much raw power the character has. It is increased through resistance training such as heavy lifting, which also has the benefit of improving the character's [[character-bmi|BIM]].

More strength will allow the character to:

* Carry heavier objects

* [[character-toughness.md|Withstand more damage]]

But at the expense of:

* Needing to eat more

* Slower movement and action speeds
