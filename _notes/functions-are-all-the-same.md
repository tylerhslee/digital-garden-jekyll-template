title: Current way of understanding the cognitive functions is too ambiguous
---

Suppose someone said, "I love traveling the world with my husband". It should be impossible to identify the cognitive type that resulted in this idea. However, so often in online communities people try to type others based on nitpicky evidence like this one. I'd like to demonstrate the silliness of strictly Jungian definitions by showing how this one statement can be attributed to all 8 conginitive funcitons.

Fe: I enjoy travling with my husband because it's how we bond. He especially loves it and watching him happy makes me happy.

Se: Traveling is fun. I get to see and experience a lot of different things.

Si: We've always traveled together. We met on a cruise 2 years ago, and ever since, we've been traveling together every year.
