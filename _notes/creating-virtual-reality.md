title: Ingredients to create virtual reality
---

Obvioulsy there are physical limitations to creating a life-size virtual reality. But how can we simulate the fundamental system upon which this reality operates?

I think what makes life compelling, and therefore worth living, is the fact that it is never perfect. In a video game, there is always that "end game" build min/maxed to perfection. Without a life-long goal, it is impossible to re-create real life. In order to simulate life, we must somehow recreate the system of balance in which every little decision has a trade-off.

I imagine this system would be modular and based on some very basic mathematic factors. Below is a growing list of such systems. 

* [[Character Physique]]

* Chatacter Intelligence

* Activities

* Food
