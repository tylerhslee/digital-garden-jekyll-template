title: Cognitive function framework is about mental function and operation, not capacity
---

When we look at cognitive functions, we need to be careful not to confuse what is achievable via superior mental capacity with what is achievable via different mental function. For example, Ne's ability to quickly jump from one connection to next should carry a neutral connotation. Whether that tendency results in desirable outcomes (e.g. proliferating ideas) or not (e.g. making spurious connections) is dependent on the individual's capacity.
